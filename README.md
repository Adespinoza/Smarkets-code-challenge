# Smarkets Coding Challenge 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and used [Smarket's API](https://docs.smarkets.com). The goal was to build a single page application using their api which contains a list of top events on the page.

### Time Completed: ~3 hours 30 minutes

I completed the coding challenge a little over 3 hours.

## Set-Up Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/Adespinoza/Smarkets-code-challenge`
Clone repository into local directory.

### `cd smarkets-coding-challenge`
Change into project working directory

### `npm install`
Install project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## To Do List
Here are some things I didn't get to, but would love to if I had more time:

- Implement React/Redux to assist in passing information around from states
- Create test files to test components and containers
- Limit the number of times API is being called to decrease latency on client side browser
- Fix styling on `EventInfoContainer` to be consistent
- Account for missing information from API in display of `EventContainer` and in `EventInfoContainer`
- Refactor code to fix redundancies (a lot of copying was done in the making of this project).
